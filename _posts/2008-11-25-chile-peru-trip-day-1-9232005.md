Poor girl, she has been driving to airport a lot lately.</span></font>

          <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;"><span>   </span>My flight from Seattle to LA was normal. One cool thing about this flight was that it flew right over Mt. St Helens. I was able to see the crater clearly. Crater was huge. Power of nature is just amazing. <span> </span>I wish that my camera were accessible. </span></font>

          <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;"><span>  </span>I took LAN Airlines flight to Santiago. Whenever I went to India, I made sure that I flew in airlines that had personal entertainment system. My favorite airline in this regard is Singapore Airlines, which has the best in-flight entertainment system in my opinion. Anyways, LAN Airlines flight that I took did not have personal entertainment system. How am I going to handle the 8 + 3 hr long flight?<span>  </span>Luckily, I had my IPOD. I had been planning to learn Spanish for a while and had been listening to a Spanish audio course. I used the flight time to listen to some of those. I got tired of Spanish course so I started listening to music. <span> </span>Listening to Ilayaraja and A.R.Rahman at 35000 feet was perfectly relaxing.</span></font>

          <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Oh! One thing if you are flying LAN Airlines and you are vegetarian then you better bring some snack. I usually do not like airline food that much with few exceptions like Singapore Airlines. I thought that I would be safe by selecting vegetarian option for my LAN flights. Boy! The food sucked. Literally, they took vegetables and steam cooked it and served it. I had two meals during my flight and the only difference was the vegetable that was used in my meal. <span> </span></span></font>
