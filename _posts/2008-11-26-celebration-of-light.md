      <p>
        <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">This weekend, I went to Vancouver, Canada to see Celebration of Light (<a href="http://www.hsbccelebrationoflight.com/fireworks/"><u><font color="#800080">http://www.hsbccelebrationoflight.com/fireworks/</font></u></a>) with few of my friends. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>This trip is fun and different because I didn’t drive in this whole trip instead used alternate means of transportation.</font></span> 
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
          
          <p>
            <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">Early Saturday morning, we got up around 4.30 and got ready for the trip.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>First part of the trip was in King County metro transit. <span> </span>As a Microsoft employee, we get flex pass which allows us to travel free on any of King County Metro bus. <span> </span>I have never used this flex pass so far. <span> </span>This is the first day I am going to use it. <span> </span>Bus 230 is scheduled to arrive at 5.30AM and it was right on time. <span> </span>This bus took me from Redmond to Bellevue transit center. <span> </span>It went in a round about way than what I would have done in my car. However, it was fun to ride the bus.</font></span> 
            
            <p>
              <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
              
              <p>
                <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">Next, I took Bus 550 from Bellevue transit center to Seattle. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>This is an express bus which means that it stops only at select stops. It took less than 15 minutes from Bellevue to Seattle.<span>  </span>I got down at 5</font><sup>th</sup> and Jackson which is close to train station.</span> 
                
                <p>
                  <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                  
                  <p>
                    <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">I took Cascade Express train from Seattle to Vancouver, Canada.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>I highly recommend this train ride.<span>  </span>For most part, the train goes along side water and it’s very scenic and beautiful. <span>  </span>It takes about 4 hrs from </font>Seattle to Vancouver. Almost twice the time it would take me if I fly low in my Beamer. However, it wouldn’t have been relaxing and scenic. </span> 
                    
                    <p>
                      <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                      
                      <p>
                        <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">We were starving by the time we reached Vancouver. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>What better place to eat than Punjabi market when you are in Vancouver. <span> </span>We decide to go there.<span>  </span>This time it is in Transit Lines, BC. <span> </span>In Vancouver, you can get a day pass for CD$8 which allows you to travel all day in their transit.<span>  </span>However, we forgot to get this thinking that we can get this in the bus. <span> </span>When we boarded the bus, driver told us that the day pass can be bought only in the stores. He was kind enough to let us in the bus and we got a free ride (Well, not exactly, we got the pass later so we paid later would be accurate way of putting it). </font></span> 
                        
                        <p>
                          <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                          
                          <p>
                            <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">We went to Himalaya restaurant in Punjabi Market. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>It’s buffet style lunch.<span>  </span>Food tasted so good and their naan is the best. <span> </span><span> </span>I ate so much because I was very hungry.<span>  </span>After lunch, we went to local store and had paan. <span> </span>I haven’t had paan in a very long time. <span> </span>After walking around the market for an hour or so, we took the bus again back to downtown to the hotel. <span> </span>I took nice power nap in the hotel for few hours.</font></span> 
                            
                            <p>
                              <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                              
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">We took bus again from hotel to Robson Street.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span><span> </span>Some of our friends chose to drive and so we all had decided that we will meet in front of hotel in Robson Street at 7.<span>  </span>One of my friends cousin lived in Vancouver and they had gone ahead to reserve a place for us in the park.<span>  </span>We all walked down to the park from Robson Street. <span> </span>The whole park was packed with people.<span>  </span>Luckily, our friend’s cousin had got a good spot for us in the park. <span> </span>By the time, the show started at 10 the park didn’t have space at all. They estimate about half million people watched this fireworks show.</font></span> 
                                
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                                  
                                  <p>
                                    <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">Celebration of Light is fireworks competition by different countries. They had other countries perform the week before and the grand finale is on Sat August 5<sup>th</sup>. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span></font></span> 
                                    
                                    <p>
                                      <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">Today, the firework was done by People Republic of China. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>They had 5 different shows during the 30 minutes show and it was amazing. <span> </span>The highlight for me was when they did Niagara Falls using fireworks and it was just mind blowing. <span>  </span>Instead of me verbalizing, I want you to take a look at pictures and video which can be viewed at the website mentioned above.</font></span>

                                        <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"></span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                                        
                                        <p>
                                          <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">After the show, we walked back to the parking lot where one of our friends had parked his car.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span><span> </span>I have never been in such a big crowd in the recent past. <span> </span>The entire downtown Vancouver streets were filled with people.<span>  </span>Every place you turn, you could only human faces.<span>  </span>The entire Robson was blocked for traffic and so it was full of people walking down the street.<span>  </span>We got a ride to the hotel.</font></span>

                                            <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                                            
                                            <p>
                                              <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">Next day, one of our friend told that he will give ride back to USA. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>We were to meet him at 11.<span>   </span>We had few hours time to kill so we decided to take a bus ride in the city. <span> </span>While we were in the bus, we realized that the pass we had is also good to use in Sea Bus and Sky train. <span> </span>We took Sky train to Water Front station.<span>  </span>From there we took a Sea Bus, which is a ferry that takes people from Vancouver to North Vancouver. <span>  </span>We went to North Vancouver and took the Sea Bus again back to Vancouver. <span> </span>We then took Sky Train again and went to Metro town where we met our friend. <span> </span><span> </span>Vancouver</font> is very well connected with combination of Bus, Sky Train and Sea Bus.</span> 
                                              
                                              <p>
                                                <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span> 
                                                
                                                <p>
                                                  <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">On our way back home, we went to Surrey.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>This place is like a mini India. We had lunch in Asian Spice.<span>  </span>This is an Indo-Chinese restaurant and the food was excellent. <span> </span>After lunch, we drove back to </font>USA which took us about 4 hours because of 1 ½ hour wait at the border. </span> 
                                                  
                                                  <p>
                                                    <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;"> </span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:#3366ff;font-size:10pt;">Overall, it was fun weekend. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>I need to use public transit more.</font></span>
