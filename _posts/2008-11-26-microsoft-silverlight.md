    Microsoft recently launched new technology called Silverlight at the Mix07 conference. If you have used Flash then this is something similiar to that.  I saw some demos of this technology and played around it with a bit and was amazed at the power of this technology.  If you think youtube is cool with its small video window, you will be amazed at what silverlight can do.  Silverlight allows you to see videos at HD quality at full screen.  Imagine it.  You don&#8217;t believe me.  See it for yourself

          It is only matter of time before a killer application that makes use of this technology comes into play.
