      <i><font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I got up around 8 on my own and realized it’s too late to go for hike. The hike is about 2hr one way and given the rate at which I walk, I estimated it to be around 2.5 hrs. It will take me about 5 hrs to finish the hike. We had booking for glacier cruise. I wasn’t sure whether I should take that hike. I decided that it’s not worth missing the glacier cruise so decided to give up on that hike. I found that there is another hike which is about 45 minutes one way.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>This hike takes you close to glaciers. Suguna wasn’t interested in hiking as she wanted to sleep in late.<span>  </span>I decided to do it on my own.</font></span></font></i>

          <i><font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>I took a hanging bridge to the beginning of trail. After I crossed the bridge, I heard some commotion and looked back.<span>  </span>I saw a girl lying flat on the bridge and there was another girl sitting close to her. I thought that someone had fainted and rushed back on the bridge.<span>  </span>When I reached close to them, I realized that they were trying to take a photograph. They saw me and realized what was happening. It was funny. Crazy girls! We were talking the same hike so decided to hike with them. Both girls were from Spain. They were doing some volunteer work in South America. They decided to check out Torres Del Paine on their way back to Spain. Of the two Balle spoke English and Eona can understand English but she will respond in Spanish.<span>  </span>Balle became the translator between us. It was interesting to talk with them. They have traveled a lot and it was interesting to listen to their stories. </font></span></font></i>

              <i><font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">The hike to glacier was easy. We went close to the glacier.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>The blueness glacier was just amazing. I got excited about the cruise trip as the cruise will take us some of the oldest glaciers in the region. I told Balle and Eona about the cruise and they were interested in the cruise too.<span>  </span>They thought that I was traveling along and asked me if I am interested in joining them.<span>  </span>I told them that I am traveling with my friend and invited them to meet up with Suguna back in the hotel.<span>  </span>We hiked back to hotel and hung out at the coffee shop.<span>  </span>Suguna also joined us after sometime. </font></span></font></i>

                  <i><font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Around 1, we took the bus from hotel that took us to dock. We took a small boat which took us the ship.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>The cruise to glacier was about 3 hours.<span>  </span>I can’t describe the view in words so check out the photos in the album to get a feel for how they looked. I have to warn you that my camera didn’t capture true view (that is the case with most places I visited in this trip). You have to visit these places to know the view. One of the highlight of this cruise was that they serve you orange juice with 300 year old ice. Balle and Iona stayed with us at the hotel.<span>  </span>We decided that we will hike Torres Del Paine again tomorrow. </font></span></font></i>
