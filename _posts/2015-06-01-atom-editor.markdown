As I blogged earlier, I have moved my blog to [Github Pages][9ab92f76] which uses markdown format and automatically converts them to html pages.  I was looking for a good markdown editor for editing my blog posts.  There are quite a few of them available and for most part they are all good in editing markdown pages.

I was looking for a markdown editor that works well  with gihub pages and automatically understands the markdown syntax used by GitHub pages.


I heard about Atom Editor through a facebook post of my friend.  Atom is designed to be developers editor. The core editor can be extended with many packages which provides additional functionality which is pretty similar to many other editors like TextMate or Sublime Text.  One such package available for Atom Editor is Markdown Preview which allows you to edit your markdown in one pane and view the rendered markdown on the right which makes is super easy to edit blog posts and in real time see them rendered.

This blog for example is edited using the Atom Editor. I am going to use Atom editor for all my blog editing and see if I can finally settle down on an editor.
