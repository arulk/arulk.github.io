          My friend Anusha keeps <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/donshu/blog/cns!CACB58593312C593!542.trak"><font color="#2771b3">wondering</font></a> and <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/donshu/blog/cns!CACB58593312C593!543.trak"><font color="#2771b3">wondering</font></a> so that made me to think if there is anything that I wonder about. I couldn&#8217;t find anything interesting that I could think of.  However, there is one thing that I wondered when I was travelling recently.

          I wonder why they ask passengers to keep the window open and foot rest up when the plane takes off or lands?  Will the plane not land or take off if the window is closed or the foot rest is down ? What&#8217;s the logic or reason for this?
