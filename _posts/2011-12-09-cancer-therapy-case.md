        Your client has approached you with a new and extremely effective cancer therapy based on physical therapy and nutrition. They have approached you and have asked you to estimate the size of the market for this therapy as well as the sustainability and have asked you to then come back to them with a recommendation as to whether or not they should pursue the opportunity and, if yes, how? If no, why not?

        The only information that was provided at the start of the case was that the client was a northeastern clinic and were treating roughly 500 people/year in that northeast location.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Information given through questioning was:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The same number of patients could be expected in all major cities, each patient made 4 visits / year and that each visit cost the patient $900. The cost to the physician for each visit was $100. The developers of the therapy (our client) received 50% of the profit ($400) and the doctor treating the patient received 50% of the profit ($400).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There are currently no competitors in the market with respect to this type of therapy.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To market the product a sales force would be needed. Each salesperson would cost $100,000/year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The procedure is not patentable and is easily copied (this information should only be given if the interviewee goes down this path).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It was up to the interviewee to estimate the number of salespeople required to serve each customer as well as the number of customers. It was up to the interviewee to reason as to who the product would be marketed to &#8211; who is the primary customer (answer: major hospitals).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Doctors within the hospitals are also the competition. In probing the competitor, it is important to know that physicians do not easily adopt the methods of other physicians if it is something that they can develop on their own, especially if they can take the entire profit.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The interviewee should also probe the experience of the client in the sales and marketing of medical treatments. The answer is that they have none but could outsource the service to a large pharmaceutical company for the same cost but would have to enter a 4 year contract requiring them to pay the salaries of the salespeople for that time period. (If this information is given, the interviewee should reason that the 4 year contract is dangerous since the treatment is easily duplicated)
