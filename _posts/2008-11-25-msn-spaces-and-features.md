        <font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">A friend of mine sent me an IM with a link to his blog. He wanted me to show his writings.<span>  </span>While browsing his blog, I noticed that he was hosting his blog at a different site and not at MSN Spaces. Being a good corporate citizen(I work for Microsoft), I wanted to know why he did not choose to host it in MSN spaces. <span> </span>He gave me few reasons as to why he did not like MSN Spaces.<span>  </span>Those reasons seemed valid and I did not have much time to spend so I let the conversation to rest. However, what my friend said bothered me.</font>

        <font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">Over the weekend, I decided to play around with MSN Space myself.<span>  </span>Initially, I rather felt disappointed with MSN spaces myself. May be I was biased with the feedback that my friend gave me.<span>  </span>I was about to give up. <span> </span>I noticed two little tabs called Customize and Settings.<span>  </span>Clicking on these tabs gave me how many different ways I could customize Spaces.</font>

      <p>
        <font color="#000080" size="2" face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif">I quickly got to work by customizing my space.<span>  </span>I am not going into detail about each of these features because Spaces help gives you detailed information on how to use them. <span> </span>However, I am going to highlight some of the features that I like.</font>

      <p>
        <font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif"><font size="2"><font color="#000080"><span>    </span>I use Messenger all the time. One of the cool features of Messenger is that whenever one of you friend has a blog entry then it notifies by putting a asterrisk right next to your friends name. This makes it easy to read your friends blogs whenever they write one.<span>   </span>Spaces also supports standard RSS feed if you are interested in using a RSS reader.</font></font></font>

MSN Spaces in addition to blogs has support for many other modules. You can add photo album, custom music list, book list etc, and I am sure that MSN will add more modules in future.</font></font></font>
