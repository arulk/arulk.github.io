Consulting firms use case interviews to gauge how well a candidate will perform. on the job. As you practice cases, keep in mind what skills and attributes the recruiters   
are looking for and take it upon yourself to demonstrate them. The following are three questions most recruiters are probably trying to answer when interviewing a   
candidate:   
**1. Can the candidate solve problems for our clients?   
**Use the case interview to demonstrate your analytical skills, logical reasoning, business savvy, and creativity. Show the interviewer that you can listen closely to the   
question being asked of you, break the problem down into components, formulate meaningful questions, proceed logically through an investigation, and draw reasonable conclusions.

**2. Can I put this candidate in front of a client?**   
Too often, candidates are only concerned with demonstrating problem-solving skills  and forget that consulting is a service industry&#8217; which values communication and presentation skills. Use the interview to demonstrate composure, maturity, and confidence. Show that you are tactful and friendly and that you can present your thoughts using clear, concise language.

**3. Will this candidate like consulting?**   
While it may sound hard,to believe at this point, case interviews can and should be a fun experience. If you look pained during the interview, the interviewer will probably   
infer that you won&#8217;t enjoy serving the frrm&#8217;s clients. Show the interviewer that you are  interested in the case and empathetic to the client, and that you have a lot of   
enthusiasm and energy.
