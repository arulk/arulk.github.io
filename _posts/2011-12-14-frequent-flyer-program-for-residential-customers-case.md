        My interviewer asked me:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “What types of affiliates would you consider in launching a frequent flyer program in the US?”
      </p>
      
      <p>
        “How much points would be transacted on the card per week?”

        Lots of information was provided on customer segmentation in the US.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You can be very creative if you attempt to provide names for the different customer segments (e.g. high earner, professionals etc.)

        (1) Identified potential customer segments based on information provided (e.g. the total number of households etc.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (2) Identified three potential affiliates: gas stations, retail (e.g JC Penney), mortgage houses
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (3) We focused on gas stations
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (4) Assumed 50 pts corresponds to $1 transacted (talked about the psychology of having a high point to dollar ratio – consumers like lots of points)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (5) Came up with an estimate of 1000 points per week assuming that the targeted consumer spends $20 per week on gas

        Don’t get caught up if you trip on something – being calm and confident will surely make you stand out from the interviewer’s perspective. Maintaining eye contact during the case interview is very important. Also, make sure to make a recommendation when you close the case.

        I always began my case interviews with a list of the major issue areas I wanted to tackle: market opportunity, technology etc. While this may sound obvious, it can prove very useful in structuring and categorizing the information provided by the interviewer. Try to avoid using complicated frameworks – they do not impress. Keep it very simple.
