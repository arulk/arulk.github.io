            <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I woke up to the announcement that the flight will land in Santiago in 15 minutes. <span> </span>I had good sleep. One thing that I liked about this trip is that it is all in the same time zone, which is good because I did not feel any jet lag.<span>  </span>Santiago airport is just like any other airport.<span>  </span>Airhostess had given two forms for immigration. I filled in only one form and went to immigration.<span>  </span>I realized my mistake only when the immigration officer asked for second form. <span> </span>Hmmm there is a reason why airhostess gave me two forms.<span>  </span>Anyways, Immigration officer asked me for the purpose of my visit and stamped my passport.</span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">My ticket was electronic so I went to LAN Airlines counter to get my flight coupon to Pt.Arenas. <span> </span>I had two hours before my flight so I lounged around in the airport. <span> </span>They had a stack of suitcases arranged like a tower. <span> </span><span> </span>After walking the airport end to end, I came to my terminal only to find that my flight is delayed by an hour. <span> </span>I was getting impatient and frustrated. <span> </span>Music came to my rescue. My flight to Pt.Arenas is about four hours with a stop in between at Puerto Montt. <span>  </span>Puerto Montt had a very small airport, which looked very cute. <span> </span>Kollywood directors would have used it as location for some romantic climax scene for their movie. <span> </span><span> </span>Descend down to Pt.Arenas was beautiful. I clicked few photos from the flight. I finally landed in Pt.Arenas. <span> </span>This is the southern most city in Chile to which LAN flies. <span>  </span></span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I got out of the airport and met up Suguna, my friend with whom I am going to travel next three weeks. <span> </span>She looked a different with her haircut short.<span>  </span>It was good to see her. <span> </span>Suguna had made reservation for us in a bus to go to Pt.Natales city where we are going to stay for the night. <span>  </span>We had time for our bus so we grabbed lunch at the airport.<span>  </span>After lunch, we boarded the bus to Pt.Natales. Driver helped us load our bags in the bus. The ride to Pt.Natales is about 2hrs.<span>  </span>The road from Pt.Arenas to Pt.Natales is in the middle of a desert so there was not much to see except for occasional sight of houses here and there. <span> </span>Suguna and I talked the whole bus ride. She told me about her trip to various ski resorts that she went and snowboarded. <span> </span>We arrived at Pt.Natales around 5.39PM. <span> </span></span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Pt.Natales is a very small town situated on the banks of a big lake. <span> </span>We grabbed our bags and wanted to go out hotel. <span> </span>Before going to hotel, Suguna wanted to find out where the grocery store is located as well as she wanted to get information from the tourist office. <span> </span>She had better knowledge of Spanish than I did so she went to gather this information while I was baby-sitting bags. <span> </span>I ended up conversing with two people from Australia.<span>  </span>They had just come back from the Torres Del Paine. They were happy about their trip and told me that I will totally enjoy it. <span> </span>I was getting excited about the trip.<span>  </span>Suguna came after 30 minutes. <span> </span>We got a taxi to go hotel as we had too many bags to carry. <span> </span>Taxi took two turns and we were already in the hotel front. <span> </span>Suguna looked up for us to stay at this place. <span> </span>However, the hotel was closed.<span>  </span>We figured out another hotel to stay from our guidebook. Taxi driver was kind enough to drive us to the new hotel. <span> </span>The new hotel was a house with rooms.<span>  </span>We got a room upstairs, which was nice and comfortable. <span>  </span>I took a nice hot shower and it felt so good after a long flight. </span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Suguna and I went to town to do some grocery shopping, as park does not have any stores inside. We got fruits, chocolates, power bars, juice etc.<span>  </span><span> </span>Everywhere I went, I was getting looks. <span> </span>I wonder if I am the first East Indian to land in their city. <span>  </span>On the way back, I went to small internet café to send email to family and friends about my arrival. I saw people using MSN messenger.<span>  </span>It seems that Messenger is popular among people compared to other IM’s. <span> </span><span> </span>I was starving so went to a local pizza place. <span> </span>We got ourselves a big pizza, which was made fresh. <span> </span>After dinner, we walked back to the hotel. I was tired so went to bed early after writing this journal.</span></font>
