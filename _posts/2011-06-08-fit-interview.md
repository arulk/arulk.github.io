      You may feel prepared to tackle the cases in your interview, but have you prepared for the personal interview as well? Too often, candidates leave that to chance; however, it is an integral part of the interview process, and it is to your advantage to spend time preparing for the fit questions.

      The personal interview may be conducted as a separate process, which usually lasts from 30 to 45 minutes, or it may be part of the few minutes the interviewer spends chatting with you before the case. Either way, the fit interview is meant to determine your interest in a consulting career and the firm, as well as to gauge how well you would fit in with the firm’s culture. While these are not malleable things, there are ways to ensure that you get those positive aspects of yourself across that you want to
