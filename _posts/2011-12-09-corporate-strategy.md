        Your client is a defense-related aerospace company that has three primary lines of business: (1) military aircraft; (2) satellite vehicles; and (3) tank armor. There have been major cutbacks in defense spending (-33%) and the company’s market capitalization is down from $25 billion to $15 billion. The CEO wants your input on what he should do.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Estimation case within the case. Okay, let’s say you’re thinking about commercializing aircraft. What would you estimate the US market for cargo aircraft to be?

        I didn’t do well on this case. (Didn’t make it past first round.) However, after talking with classmates, the objectives seemed to be: (1) does the candidate have intellectual curiosity about what is going on with this company?; (2) can the person identify strategies for proceeding; (3) can the person explore one or two of them in a structured way; (4) can the person handle a tough estimation case. Some more specifics of what they probably wanted me to look into…
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (1) Explore each of the business lines.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (2) Explore commercialization of some of their business.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (3) Perhaps more…

        This seemed to be a case to see how a person structured his/her thinking without a definite “solution.” I proposed that there were four general strategies that could be pursued (diversification, exporting, merger, divestiture), and the interviewer then gave me an estimation case.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Feedback on the estimation case was “not very good job with the estimation.” I thought this was pretty tough estimation case and am still a little stumped by it. I thought about approaching this by estimating (a) the total number of cargo aircraft currently in use, (b) estimating an aircraft’s useful life, and then dividing (a) by (b) to get an annual market figure. To calculate (a), I thought about doing it in two ways: (1) approximating the number of cargo aircraft out there by judging from what I’ve personally seen at airports; and (2) estimating that a certain value of goods per person in the US is transported by air, translating that into weight, and figuring out the capacity of aircraft that would be necessary to transport the load. I went with option (2). I got an initial estimate of 300 planes, which I thought was too low, so I bumped it up by a factor of 10. He seemed a little dissatisfied. He then asked me “what if the margin on planes were $5 M”, and then we ran out of time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I knew a fair amount about military aviation before the interview and was perhaps hurt by the fact that I had trouble envisioning a defense aerospace company suddenly coming out with a commercial version of a military transport aircraft. (I probably should have asked what kinds of aircraft they had in their portfolio, however, to let him steer me.) The case seemed to be going in a naive direction… but I didn’t make it to the second round, so I must have missed something.

        My pitfall was not exploring each of the business lines in a structured way, thereby getting some basic facts. Beats the hell out of me what he wanted with the estimation case…

        One of the tougher cases I had during DIP week. Interviewer frequently interrupted me and gave me “the stare.” Keep your composure and don’t sweat it, you’ll be fine. They’re putting on an act just like you are, especially the ones who have something to prove and put on an attitude.
