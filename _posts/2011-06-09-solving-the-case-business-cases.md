      <b>Listen to the Question</b>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      While it sounds obvious, you need to listen very closely to the business situation described by the interviewer. Often imbedded in what the interviewer is saying are helpful hints about how to proceed with the case.

      <b>Gather Information</b>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      The first step in the information gathering step is to make sure you understand the  question. While it is not important to repeat back the question to the interviewer, question anything that you are not clear about.  Your approach will depend on the amount of information you receive up front, which can differ greatly depending on the style of the interviewer and the type of cases you get. Some interviewers will give a lot of detailed information up front and will volunteer relatively little additional information later. In such cases, it may make sense to write down some quick notes to help you remember the pertinent facts. Other interviewers start out with a simple two-sentence summary, and expect you to probe for more information by asking thoughtful questions. Remember, it is expected that you ask questions; one of the most valuable skills of a successful consultant is the ability to ask probing questions. Sometimes it helps to preface a series of questions with a statement describing where you are going with your questioning. So you   may say something like, .Now I’d like to ask some questions about the client’s distribution channels..

    <b>Analyze the Problem</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    When you have gathered your initial information, think clearly about the problem you are being asked to solve. It is fine to take a moment to collect your thoughts, but don.t forget how important it is to maintain eye contact. A major consulting firm said that many interviewing students spend too much time at the beginning of the case with their facts buried in their notes. You should ponder the case to yourself just long enough for you to lay out a framework for analyzing the case step by step. Then clearly layout how you will approach the problem . interviewers cannot read your mind, so the more that you tell them about your thought process the better.Remember that the purpose of using a framework is to structure your thinking logically and to make your logic transparent to the interviewer. Do not get the impression that there is a .right. framework that you can learn in class and memorize. The textbook frameworks of your introductory business school classes  should only be a guide in helping you start to

    think about frameworks. Blindly applying a framework will make your solution seem canned. Keep in mind that creativity and originality are also highly valued by consulting firms. Think logically about what a good way to approach the problem would be, relying as much on your life experiences to develop your approach as on any standard framework.An attribute of a good framework is that it be .MECE,. which stands for Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive. This means that your framework should  provide you with a number of different options that do not overlap (the ME of MECE)and together account for all possible causes (the CE of MECE). For example, if you are being asked to solve a problem about declining profitability, do not just look at the expense side of the income statement. Profitability is a function of revenues and expenses, and these two factors are separate while together they make up the entire formula for profitability.Listen carefully to any clues the interviewer may give you. If you go down the wrong path, the interviewer will often try to redirect you. For example, when the interviewer says: .Are you sure about that?. or .Is that the only possible solution?. you should probably reevaluate your analysis. Do not be afraid to discard your framework or line of questioning and use something else. For example, if you initially interpreted the problem to be a marketing problem, but then realize from subsequent information the interviewer provided that it is really an operations problem, just say that you will use a different approach to probe deeper into that aspect of the case. If you get stuck, summarize what you have found out up to that point. That helps the interviewer trace your line of thought and buys you some time to think about where to go next. Finally, use simple language. Consultants are not looking for you to use buzz words.Talk to the interviewer as if you’re talking to your friends, family, or former coworkers. It will make you seem more natural, and give the interviewer confidence that you can communicate clearly with clients.

    <b>Summarize Your Findings</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    This is the step that many interviewees miss . make sure that you answer the question that they asked you at the beginning. For example if they asked you what to recommend to their client, do not give an answer that summarizes their situation only.

    They will be looking for you to take the step towards framing the findings into a client solution. Because of the complexity of some of the cases you will be presented with, it may not be possible to get to the point where you start making suggestions for improvements in the time frame allotted. This does not matter, as long as you demonstrated your ability to think clearly and to apply the correct business tools to get to the causes of the problem. The firm probably took weeks rather than just thirty minutes to get to the point where you stopped in the interview. Just push back and give a .big picture. summary of what you have found out up to that point and how you would proceed with your analysis. Try to be especially articulate when giving your wrap-up summary of the case
