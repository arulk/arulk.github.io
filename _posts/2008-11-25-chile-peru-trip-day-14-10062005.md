      <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">We went to the nearby handicraft market to buy some gifts for Sandy. Sandy is leaving today to USA. After shopping Sandy got a taxi from the hostel and took off. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>Suguna and I went to tourist person to talk about our plans for next two days. We finalized that we will spend a day mostly in Cusco then go to Nazca to see Nazca lines from there go to Pisco (a beach city) and to Lima and fly from there to USA. Next, I went to museum of Inka while suguna went to handicraft store for shopping. Museum of Inca was interesting. They had all artifacts from Inca period as exhibits. I was looking for how Machu Pichu was formed etc but didn’t quite find the information. Suguna and I were supposed to meet up at a plaza but it turned to be a square. I walked to handicraft store hoping to catch her there but couldn’t meet up with her</font></span></font>

        <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I took taxi and came back to plaza again. She came there 15 minutes. Both of us went to a cute little vegetarian restaurant. I liked the ambience of the restaurant but the food was ok. I didn’t quite finish the food there. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>Both of us then went to a place called sun blas. <span> </span>San blas is the art area of Cusco pretty much every store in this area is an art gallery or handicraft store. We pretty much spend the whole day going to various stores in the area. I tried to buy some painting here but couldn’t decide on what to buy. <span> </span>I came back to hostel as I was tired of shopping. <span> </span>Later, Suguna and I went to the handicraft center to do some purchase. We got back to hostel. <span> </span>Suguna wasn’t hungry so I went out and got myself dinner.</font></span></font>
