    I liked the movie Ullame Kekkumae which was directed by Jeeva.  I liked that movie so much because the story line was very well crafted.  One of the songs in that movie "oh manamae" is something that I must have listened to millions times.  It is one of most played songs in my playlist.  When I heard that the director Jeeva has come out with a new movie, I was eager to watch it.

      Similar to his last movie, this movie is also about relationship.  It is about people who are in love with each other but can&#8217;t understand each other.  The misunderstanding leads to them breaking up.  They go their way but destiny has them meetin up again in a foreign land. Only this time, there is another person involved and how this affects their relationship.  They end up splitting up but only this time that they split knowing that they love each other but they are two very diffrent persons with very different expectations.

        The director finishes movie summarizing it as

          "காதலிச்சு கல்யாணம் பண்ணிகிட்டவங்களுக்கு காதல் எப்பவுமே நெனைச்சு பாக்குற சந்தோஷம் ஆனா பிரிச்சவங்களுக்கு எப்பவுமே நெனைச்சுட்டு இருக்கிற வலி. சந்தோஷ வலி"

            Movie is shot in Australia. The locations are just amazing and it has made me to think about when I can plan my trip to Australia.  Harris Jayaraj music is very good.  Mudal Mudalaga song is very melodious and it is going to go into my playlist of Arul&#8217;s favorites.
