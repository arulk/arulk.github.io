      <font size="2"><font color="#004080" face="Trebuchet MS">Wednesday marked the beginning of half marathon training session. I am all geared up with hind jersey, shorts, brooks Addiction 6 shoes which I bought for half marathon at REI. Asha Seattle group with which I train meets every Wednesday at Kirkland Everyday Athlete to do speed training. <span> </span>Chuck our coach wanted to do a test to see where people are at their training.<span>  </span><span> </span>We started from Everyday Athlete and ran to a nearby school.<span>  </span>I wanted to run at a pace that was comfortable for me but my pace was slowest among people so I was the last one in the pack.<span>   </span><span> </span>Coach Chuck slowed down and started running with me. Chuck said, “No man is left behind.” <span> </span>He told me not to worry about running slow and asked me to run at a pace that is comfortable for me.</font></font>

          <font size="2"><font color="#004080" face="Trebuchet MS">Chuck wanted everyone of us to run around the track so that we could time how fast we are running.<span>   </span>Track is about ¼ mile and<span>  </span>he wanted people to run for 2 miles (8 laps).<span>  </span>For beginners, he asked us to run 1 mile (4 laps).<span>   </span>I started running along with others at my usual running pace.<span>  </span><span> </span>It was enjoyable run, however It didn’t like pressure I felt when others were running fast.<span>  </span>I ignored completely in my mind.<span>  </span>Turned up the volume in my IPod and was running.<span>    </span>Lap 1 : 2.55, Lap 2: 6.02<span>  </span>… I completed Lap4 12:05.<span>  </span>I was done with my mile , but I continued to run.<span>  </span>Chuck asked me if I wanted to do 2 mile and I said, “Yes!”.<span>  </span>Lap 5, Lap6, Lap7<span>  </span>and Lap 8 : 25:05.<span>    </span>Veteran runners had completed their 2 mile early.<span>   </span>Some New comers stopped with their 1 mile run.<span>  </span>Some new comers continued with 2 mile and were ahead of me.<span>  </span>Probably, I was the last one to complete the 2 mile run with 25:05. I was happy that I completed the 2 mile run without stopping. It might not be a big deal for others, but It was a great achievement because I could hardly run few hundred yards before.<span>  </span>After training, We ran back to the store where we had originally started. Again, I was the last one in time.</font></font>
