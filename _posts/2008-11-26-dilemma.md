      As you know, I am starting business school soon and so decided that I will sell motorcycle because I won&#8217;t be riding it much this summer.   This morning as I was getting ready to leave, I saw my motorcycle in the garage.  It was nice and sunny outside so decided may be I should ride the bike to work today.  I geared up and started my bike and boy it was vroooooommmming to go.

      I rode slow in the community and it was nothing great. Once I got on the highway, I turned up the acceleration and I was cruising at 70.  The fresh air, adrenaline rush, alertness  was unbelievable.  I felt that all my senses were working together and I was feeling alive.

        My Dilemma is whether to sell bike or not.
