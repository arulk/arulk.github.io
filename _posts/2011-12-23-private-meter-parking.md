      <p>
        “Estimate the annual profit for privatized meter parking in Center City and please recommend whether I should invest in this business or not.”

        Only the information above. I was very free to make assumptions. However, make sure that you engage the interviewer by clearly stating your assumptions and testing their validity with the interviewer.

        I approached this as an NPV analysis.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My approach was as follows:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (1) Revenues (estimate the market size based on a measure such as number of meter polls per square block; the number of square blocks in Center City etc.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (2) Costs (fixed, variable, SG&A etc.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (3) Resulting cash flow stream into perpetuity (to make it very simple)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (4) Used a discount rate of 10% (seemed reasonable)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        (5) My answer ended up being $10M/.10 = $100M (though this is based on the numerous assumptions I made) – therefore I recommended that my interviewer invest in this business.

        Don’t get caught up if you trip on something – being calm and confident will surely make you stand out from the interviewer’s perspective. Maintaining eye contact during the case interview is very important. Also, make sure to make a recommendation when you close the case.

        I always began my case interviews with a list of the major issue areas I wanted to tackle: market opportunity, technology etc. While this may sound obvious, it can prove very useful in structuring and categorizing the information provided by the interviewer. Try to avoid using complicated frameworks – they do not impress. Keep it very simple.
