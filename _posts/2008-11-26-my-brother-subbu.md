      My brother has been a victim of polio as new born so he is physically challenged. He has been avoiding getting married because  he didn&#8217;t want someone to think of him as burden.  We all in our family are very protective of him and we always wanted him to get married and have someone special in his life. Our prayers have been answered.  My brother  is getting married next month. My future sister-in-law  Raji is able to see him as person beyond his physical disability. Hats off to her kindness.  I am very happy and excited about this marriage.  I sincerely pray and hope for their happy married life.

      If you are going to be in India on April 16th, please do come to my brother&#8217;s wedding.  Please send me mail and I will share the details once it is finalized.
