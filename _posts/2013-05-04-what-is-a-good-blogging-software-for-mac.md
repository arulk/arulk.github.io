I have used Windows Live writer as my blogging software tool for many years. This is a great tool that works very well with many blogging platforms. Recently, I have been using Mac OS X as my primary operating system to do mobile development (iOS applications can be developed only on Mac). I would like to know if there is a good blog editing software for Mac ?

Do you have any recommendations ?

**<u>Update</u>**: Since writing this blog post, I have got many responses for MarsEdit. Looks like Marsedit is the closest to Windows Live writer on Mac. It is not free so I am going to give it a try by downloading their trial software.
