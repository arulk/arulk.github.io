        There are two factories owned by an ice cream maker. One is located inland California and one in the Midwest. Demand is currently not being met. Your job as a consultant is to give the owner strategic direction on how to meet demand.

        All information was provided only after I specifically asked. Only specific cost information was volunteered.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Factories have the same costs currently.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There is no ability to expand capacity in the California factory (all land around it was owned).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Midwest factory is over-capacity currently with unionized workers working over time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There is an option to expand the factory in the Midwest (reducing union OT) which has about the same cost factor.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There is an option to purchase a factory on the East (lower cost to produce but higher transportation costs in refrigerated trucks).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There is an option to outsource production and transportation at a lower cost.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Union leaders are very wary of taking away overtime and there was previously union unrest in the midwest factory which caused a stop in production, leading to extremely high costs of missed demand.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The outsourcer has been used by this firm before, has excellent credentials, would share R&D information, would allow joint quality control, would not share competitive information, etc.

        This was a real case that the interviewer had worked on and so had an “ideal solution”. The decision was made to close the Midwest factory with no notice in order to inhibit sabotage. All ice cream was outsourced.

        The case giver did not want to focus on operational issues to improve the over-capacity Midwest facility. It was easy to fall in the trap of throwing out throughput, bottlenecks, etc. but after checking back with the interview they preferred a strict focus on the make vs. buy decision.

      <p>
        In this case it was key to be know the make vs. buy trade-offs and to ask very specific questions. A cost/benefit approach seemed to be appreciated. None of the information was volunteered so it required the interviewee to be highly organized and to explore each option thoroughly, then encapsulate it and relate it back to the interviewer. The Union issues could have been easily overlooked and they became central to the correct solution.
