        <b>Solution:</b>

      <p>
        Note: Bain first round cases tend to be simple but the key is to understand the issues.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The first part of the solution is explaining the downtrend in newsprint consumption. That is fairly straightforward: Gradual decline in number of newspapers. Availability of substitutes to newspapers such as television, internet has caused newsprint consumption to gradually show a decline.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The second and more crucial part is identifying that the periodicity of the swings corresponds to the business cycle. Now the question is why is there such large amplitude for these swings. Think about say “Red Herring” during the booming economy days – filled and fat with advertising pages. It goes for Real Estate advertising in San Jose Mercury! During boom times, advertising demand and general economic activity drive the newsprint consumption. During recessions or downswings, the demand is much lower.

        Many, many pitfalls! The key is to keep focusing on the broad issues rather than on complicated explanations for the demand pattern.

        Speed is critical in answering Bain cases. For example, the same case was provided to all the interviewees facing this particular interviewer. Later the interviewer confided that he chose the fastest six responses!
