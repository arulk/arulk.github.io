      <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">We got taxi and came to hotel where we are supposed to meet Sandy. However she didn’t come to Puno. We freshened up ourselves in hotel and had breakfast there. We checked email and found that sandy is in Cusco</span></font>

        <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">. We decided to go to Cusco. We got taxi back to bus station. We asked taxi driver to get us bus to Cusco. This was another 6 hour ride to Cusco. I was still feeling cold and feverish. I had taken tablets.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>I wrote this journal during my bus ride to Cusco.<span>  </span>Traveling through bus is the best way to see the country. Peru looked like a very poor country. It reminded of my travel through Indian villages. <span> </span>I had been traveling for the past two days and it was making me tired. I listened to music during the ride.<span>  </span>I was missing people, Seattle, my bed in the house etc.<span>   </span>I had never hiked up that much in Seattle and in the last week, I had hiked so much.<span>  </span>I was putting my body through a lot of pain and was working muscles that I never knew existed, but being part of nature and all the views that I was seeing were mind blowing. Personally, the sense of achievement that I got at the end of 8 hours of hike was very satisfying.</font></span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Bus reached Cusco after 7 hours. We took a taxi to the hotel.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>Cusco looked like a more modern city that the other places I saw in Peru. Sandy had booked us a hotel in a city center.<span>  </span>It was good to see Sandy. It was 7 in the evening. Sandy said that the tour people will pick us up by 7 in the morning. The first thing that I had noticed about Cusco was that it was hard to breathe. I took shower and freshened up. <span> </span>I decided to go for a walk in the city. My cannon batter was not holding charge so wanted to change them before I went to Machu Pichu hike. I went to get battery. There were people everywhere.<span>  </span>I walked a block and saw a huge palace with a square in front of it.<span>   </span>There were stores all around the square. I got two batteries for my camera. <span> </span>Sandy, Suguna and I went to dinner at Inca Grill. <span> </span>I had Thai soup and ravioli. Food was excellent.<span>  </span>We also had cocoa tea which made my breathing easier.<span>   </span>I took tablets for fever and height. I went to bed early.<span>  </span>I was feeling apprehensive as well as excited about the Machu Pichu hike.</font></span></font>
