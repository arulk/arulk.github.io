        <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"><font color="#4f81bd">Love by Swami Vivekananda …….</font></span> 
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"><font color="#4f81bd">I once had a friend who grew to be very close to me. Once when we were sitting at the edge of a swimming pool, she filled the palm of her hand with some water and held it before me, and said this: “You see this water carefully contained on my hand? It symbolizes Love.</font></span> 
          
          <p>
            <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"></span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"><font color="#4f81bd">This was how I saw it: As long as you keep your hand caringly open and allow it to remain there, it will always be there. However, if you attempt to close your fingers round it and try to posses it, it will spill through the first cracks it finds. </font></span> 
            
            <p>
              <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"></span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"><font color="#4f81bd">This is the greatest mistake that people do when they meet love … </font></span> 
              
              <p>
                <font color="#4f81bd"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;">They try  to posses it, they  demand, they expect … and just like the water spilling out of your hand, love will retrieve from you. For love is meant to be free, you can not change its nature.</span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"> </span></font> 
                
                <p>
                  <span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"></span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"><font color="#4f81bd">If there are people you love, allow them to be free beings.<br />Give and don’t expect.<br />Advise, but don’t order.<br />Ask, but never demand.<br />It might sound simple, BUT it is a lesson that may take a lifetime to truly practice.</font></span> 
                  
                  <p>
                    <font color="#4f81bd"><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;">It is the secret to true love. To truly practice it, you must sincerely feel no expectations from those who you love, and yet an unconditional caring.</span><span style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS';color:#ff6600;"> </span></font>
