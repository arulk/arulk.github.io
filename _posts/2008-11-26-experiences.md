    There are many things in life that you don&#8217;t know what it feels like until you experience it.  No amount of explanations, pictures, videos help you to get the sense that you get when you experience things first hand.   This weekend I had two such experiences. 
    
    <p>
      First, the experience of white water rafting in Wenatchee river.  This is the first time I have done rafting.  The experience of paddling against gushing water is uniqu.

        The second experience is that of near death experience. While rafting, our friend Suhasini fell into the water.  She is such a brave and she hold onto the rope that was going around the raft. I was the one who was close to her and I reached out and grabbed her. Even though she had a hold of rope, she sunk once in the water and she was terrified. I grabbed and tried to pull her and I couldn&#8217;t do it first time. She went into water. When she came out, I could see the fear in the eyes and face. I still can&#8217;t forget her face.  This time around I didn&#8217;t want to let her go and used all my strength to pull her into the raft.

          We take life for granted. Little do we realize that all it takes is a second to change things upside down for us.   What happened to Suhasini could have happened to any one of us.  She is brave girl who survived this and  took it in right spirit by writing a <a href="http://hasini.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!272865C4DBDA45B1!157.entry">blog</a> about it.

            I hope that I didn&#8217;t scare anyone who was thinking about doing white water rafting by sharing this experience.  I highly recommend you to experience it.  I am sure that even Suhasini will say that the swim in the rapid although scary was lot of fun  <img alt="smile_regular" src="http://i2.wp.com/spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_regular.gif?w=696" data-recalc-dims="1" />
