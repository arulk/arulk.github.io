    I had an interesting and  heated conversation with a friend of mine. Our point of discussion was whether casteism still exists or not?  We both agreed that casteism is still very much prevalent in India, in particular villages.  However, our point of disagreement was whether casteism exists with educated adults in particular people who are in USA.

      My friend said that for most part people who have come here and educated are more broad minded and are able to go beyond the boundaries of caste and look at people for their qualities.  My point of argument was that casteism is still very much prevalent among people who have moved here and I added that there is nothing broad minded or narrow minder about it.  It is a matter of choice and compatibility and you shouldn&#8217;t judge people for this. Just like people want to be associated  with people with similar tastes, many people prefer to get married or settled down with someone who comes from a similar background.  This is no different from a non smoker expecting to get married to a non smoker  or some one passionate about traveling wanting to get married to someone who is also passionate about traveling.

        I at least know of two  of my friends who were particular about caste and good married to someone from their caste.  There is nothing right or wrong about it. In fact in my friends&#8217; case it turned out to be good as well as bad.  One friend of mine got married to someone from her caste because of pressure from her parents and relatives but the person she got married to ended up being wrong choice for her and they are not compatible at all.  On the other hand,  this other friend of mine feared that if she got married to someone outside of her caste, she will be treated badly among her relatives and decided to get married to someone from her caste.  She is happy and well settled.

          Two very similar situation but very different results.  Even though we could easily associate things working out or not working out to caste, I believe that it is not the underlying reason.  A couple from very different background can be happy, along similar thought a couple from very similar background can be in a bad relationship.  At the end of day, it is all about compatibility.

            I know this is a sensitive topic and many people have strong opinions about this.  Do you have comments?
