    <p>
      I try to be a good father. Give my kids mulligans. Work nights to pay<br />for their text messaging. Take them to swimsuit shoots.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But compared with Dick Hoyt, I suck.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Eighty-five times he&#8217;s pushed his disabled son, Rick, 26.2 miles in<br />marathons. Eight times he&#8217;s not only pushed him 26.2 miles in a<br />wheelchair but also towed him 2.4 miles in a dinghy while swimming and<br />pedaled him 112 miles in a seat on the handlebars&#8211;all in the same<br />day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Dick&#8217;s also pulled him cross-country skiing, taken him on his back<br />mountain climbing and once hauled him across the U.S. on a bike. Makes<br />taking your son bowling look a little lame, right?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And what has Rick done for his father? Not much&#8211;except save his life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This love story began in Winchester, Mass., 43 years ago, when Rick<br />was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth, leaving him<br />brain-damaged and unable to control his limbs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;He&#8217;ll be a vegetable the rest of his life;&#8221; Dick says doctors told<br />him and his wife, Judy, when Rick was nine months old. &#8220;Put him in an<br />institution.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But the Hoyts weren&#8217;t buying it. They noticed the way Rick&#8217;s eyes<br />followed them around the room. When Rick was 11 they took him to the<br />engineering department at Tufts University and asked if there was<br />anything to help the boy communicate. &#8220;No way,&#8221; Dick says he was<br />told.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      `There&#8217;s nothing going on in his brain.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      "Tell him a joke,&#8221; Dick countered. They did. Rick laughed. Turns out<br />a lot was going on in his brain.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Rigged up with a computer that allowed him to control the cursor by<br />touching a switch with the side of his head, Rick was finally able to<br />communicate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First words? &#8220;Go Bruins!&#8221; And after a high school classmate was<br />paralyzed in an accident and the school organized a charity run for<br />him, Rick pecked out, &#8220;Dad, I want to do that.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Yeah, right. How was Dick, a self-described &#8220;porker&#8221; who never ran<br />more than a mile at a time, going to push his son five miles? Still,<br />he tried.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;Then it was me who was handicapped,&#8221; Dick says. &#8220;I was sore for two weeks.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That day changed Rick&#8217;s life. &#8220;Dad,&#8221; he typed, &#8220;when we were<br />running, it felt like I wasn&#8217;t disabled anymore!&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And that sentence changed Dick&#8217;s life. He became obsessed with giving<br />Rick that feeling as often as he could. He got into such hard-belly<br />shape that he and Rick were ready to try the 1979 Boston Marathon.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;No way,&#8221; Dick was told by a race official. The Hoyts weren&#8217;t quite<br />a single runner, and they weren&#8217;t quite a wheelchair competitor. For a<br />few years Dick and Rick just joined the massive field and ran anyway,<br />then they found a way to get into the race officially: In 1983 they<br />ran another marathon so fast they made the qualifying time for Boston<br />the following year.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Then somebody said, &#8220;Hey, Dick, why not a triathlon?&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      How&#8217;s a guy who never learned to swim and hadn&#8217;t ridden a bike since<br />he was six going to haul his 110-pound kid through a triathlon? Still,<br />Dick tried.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now they&#8217;ve done 212 triathlons, including four grueling 15-hour<br />Ironmans in Hawaii. It must be a buzzkill to be a 25-year-old stud<br />getting passed by an old guy towing a grown man in a dinghy, don&#8217;t you<br />think?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hey, Dick, why not see how you&#8217;d do on your own? &#8220;No way,&#8221; he says.<br />Dick does it purely for &#8220;the awesome feeling&#8221; he gets seeing Rick<br />with a cantaloupe smile as they run, swim and ride together.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This year, at ages 65 and 43, Dick and Rick finished their 24th Boston<br />Marathon, in 5,083rd place out of more than 20,000 starters. Their<br />best time&#8217;? Two hours, 40 minutes in 1992&#8211;only 35 minutes off the<br />world record, which, in case you don&#8217;t keep track of these things,<br />happens to be held by a guy who was not pushing another man in a<br />wheelchair at the time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;No question about it,&#8221; Rick types. &#8220;My dad is the Father of the Century.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And Dick got something else out of all this too. Two years ago he had<br />a mild heart attack during a race. Doctors found that one of his<br />arteries was 95% clogged. &#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t been in such great shape,&#8221;<br />one doctor told him, &#8220;you probably would&#8217;ve died 15 years ago.&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So, in a way, Dick and Rick saved each other&#8217;s life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Rick, who has his own apartment (he gets home care) and works in<br />Boston, and Dick, retired from the military and living in Holland,<br />Mass., always find ways to be together. They give speeches around the<br />country and compete in some backbreaking race every weekend, including<br />this Father&#8217;s Day.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      That night, Rick will buy his dad dinner, but the thing he really<br />wants to give him is a gift he can never buy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &#8220;The thing I&#8217;d most like,&#8221; Rick types, &#8220;is that my dad sit in the<br />chair and I push him once.&#8221;
