      To analyze  a company&#8217;s strategy  in terms of its chosen market position,  you  have  to  evaluate the  different factors that  will determine its  success.   Customers&#8217;  needs  have to be known and  the firm&#8217;s  capacity and  cost structure need to be able  to satisfy those needs at an acceptable level of profitability.  This capacity and  cost structure should be difficult to imitate by the firm&#8217;s competitors in order to sustain the profitability.
