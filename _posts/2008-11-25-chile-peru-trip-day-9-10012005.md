      <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I had a good night sleep and got up early around 5.30 AM. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>I started packing for the hike. I had pack down to reasonable weight for me to carry.<span>  </span>Tour operators picked us up at 7. Along the way, we also picked up two other people for the hike. They were from Brazil. <span> </span>We drove to a point called 82KM point. This is the point where the trail begins. We got introduced to our guide Sylvia. She is local Peruvian who spoke English. We shopped at a small town on way called Ollantaytambo where we had our breakfast.<span>  </span>People were selling cool hiking sticks with handiwork.<span>  </span>I got myself two hiking sticks. We drove to the start of hiking point. <span> </span>We all geared up and started the hike. <span> </span>WE entered the hike. Our guide started the hike by saying that Inca’s did this hike as a pilgrimage. She said that before they started the pilgrimage they did a ritual. She asked us to do the ritual.<span>  </span>We took three leaves of cocoa making one wish and think about two favorite places, Machu Pick and say Casa Appu after each one of them.<span>   </span>After the ritual, she asked us to take a rock and carry it with us all the way to the top. The belief is that based on size of stone you carry, you sin will be resolved. </font></span></font>

          <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">We started the hike from Pisa Coucho. The first part of hike was steep but later it was flat and became steep again before we stopped for lunch. We had 5 porters carrying our cooking and camp stuff. They went ahead and had setup our lunch. For lunch, we had baby corn soup, cocoa tea and pasta. I was so hungry that I ate all of them. Afternoon hike was even harder for about 30 minutes. The hike was very steep. Views along the hike were very pretty. Last part of the hike was pretty flat and we reached our camp site. I had my own tent for sleeping which was nice. We had a tea break with biscuits, popcorn etc.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>Dinner was served at 7. It was already dark. <span> </span>I got into tent and changed into thermal. Until dinner, I was listening to IPOD.</font></span></font>
