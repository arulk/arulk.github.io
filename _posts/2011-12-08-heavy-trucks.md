**Q****u****e****s****t****i****o****n**** (p****o****s****e****d**** b****y**** i****n****t****e****r****viewer): ** 

A heavy truck manufacturer with operations in Europe and the U.S. has experienced growing market share combined with declining profitability. An HBS expert has declared that outsourcing is the wave of the future while a Stanford business professor has claimed that it’s not the panacea some make it out to be. Your client wants to know what they should do. What issues would you need to consider in order to make a recommendation?

(Note: very little information was given. The interviewee was tasked with developing 

a framework for making a recommendation.) 

Competition 

· Several competitors have begun to outsource pieces of the truck 

Product 

· There are “non-viewable” components such as frame rails that are low-cost, low- tech and “viewable” components such as the cab that are high-cost and high-tech (heavy labor and material content). 

Costs &#8211; Cabs 

· The company has invested a significant amount of money in a stamping machine 

for cabs. 

· Variable costs per cab include:

**So****lut****i****o****n****:**** ** 

The following issues should be considered when deciding whether or not to 

outsource: 

1. Amount of cost reduction 

2. Difficulty of maintaining quality control (cost of legal expenses,management time, etc.) 

3. Capacity constraints of suppliers 

4. Number/ type of suppliers 

5. Brand/ quality perception of customers 

6. Proprietary process/ product? 

In this case, it is easy to verify that the low-cost, low-tech components should be outsourced. Therefore, we spent most of the time reviewing the impact of outsourcing cabs. 

To do this, we examined the cost components and found that it would be desirable to outsource if the price to the company would be below $700. The depreciation expense is unavoidable and thus, should not be included in the decision-making process. As it turned out, a price below $1,000 was easily attainable but not one beneath $700.
