        I got MBA from Wharton Business School.  Many friend who come to hear of my education want to know more about it.  They want to know more about the courses , what I learned, the experience of doing it.  I have realized that many people have lot of interest in acquiring business knowledge but not necessarily interested in going back to school.  Although it is not substitute for going to school, you can learn many of the concepts taught in business. Here is the  curriculum that we followed at Wharton. I will write more blogs on this topic in my future posts.
