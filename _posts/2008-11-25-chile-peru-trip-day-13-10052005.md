      <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">As usual, I got up early, took shower, and ate breakfast at the hotel itself. The weather was very pleasant.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>It was time to pack up and checkout hotel. Our train to Cusco was at 4.45pm. We left hotel around 10 AM. We walked in the town. It was pretty small town and it was interesting to walk. There was a local market where people were selling handicrafts. We spend more than an hour in the market. We didn’t have a lot of money as we didn’t think we will require them during hike. <span> </span>Suguna and Sandy bought “I survived Machu Pichu hike” t-shirt. Someone said there is a museum of Inca’s so we thought of checking that out</font></span></font>

          <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">We must have walked for at least 30 minutes and we couldn’t find it so we returned. Sandy wanted to go to hotel as she was not feeling well with mosquito bites. We went back to the hotel. We found a restaurant near the hotel where we ate our lunch. I wanted to have coffee so went to a café. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>Suguna and I were chatting for a long time while sandy was a silent spectator. Around 4 o clock, we went back to hotel to collect our bags and walked to the train station. At train station, I bought a painting for home. We also met out Brazil friends who hiked with us on Machu Pichu trail. The train ride was very good.</font></span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">The train track was going alongside a river and in the valley between mountains. I thoroughly enjoyed the train ride. We were picked up by the tour operator and were driven. The ride back to Cusco was an hour. I slept off during most of the ride. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>Once we got to the hostel, I checked email and send email to people about my trip. Later, Suguna, Sandy and I went to a Chinese restaurant to get out dinner</font></span></font><font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">The restaurant was on 1<sup>st</sup> floor overlooking the main square in Cusco. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>All of us were very tired so hit bed early</font></span></font>
