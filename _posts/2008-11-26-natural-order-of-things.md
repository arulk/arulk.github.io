        <font face="Verdana"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-size:12pt;"><font color="#0070c0">At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children,<br />the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be<br />forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated<br />staff, he offered a question: &#8216;When not interfered with by outside<br />influences, everything nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son,<br />Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things<br />as other children do. Where is the natural order of things in my son?&#8217;</p> 
        
        <p>
          The audience was stilled by the query.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The father continued. &#8216;I believe that when a child like Shay, physically<br />and mentally handicapped comes into the world, an opportunity to realize<br />true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people<br />treat that child.&#8217;
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Then he told the following story:
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were<br />playing baseball. Shay asked, &#8216;Do you think they&#8217;ll let me play?&#8217; Shay&#8217;s<br />father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their<br />team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play,<br />it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be<br />accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Shay&#8217;s father approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not<br />expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and<br />said, &#8216;We&#8217;re losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I<br />guess he can be on our team and we&#8217;ll try to put him in to bat in the ninth<br />inning.&#8217;
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Shay struggled over to the team&#8217;s bench and, with a broad smile, put on a<br />team shirt. His Father watched with a small tear in his eye and warmth in<br />his heart. The boys saw the father&#8217;s joy at his son being accepted. In the<br />bottom of the eighth inning, Shay&#8217;s team scored a few runs but was still<br />behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and<br />played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was<br />obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from<br />ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of the<br />ninth inning, Shay&#8217;s team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases<br />loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be<br />next at bat.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the<br />game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all<br />but impossible because Shay didn&#8217;t even know how to hold the bat properly,<br />much less connect with the ball.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the<br />other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay&#8217;s life, moved<br />in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make<br />contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The<br />pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.<br />As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball<br />right back to the pitcher.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and<br />could have easily thrown the ball to
        </p>
        
        <p>
          the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been the end<br />of the game.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman&#8217;s head, out<br />of reach of all team mates. Everyone from the stands and both teams started<br />yelling, &#8216;Shay, run to first! Run to first!&#8217; Never in his life had Shay ever<br />run that far, but he made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline,<br />wide-eyed and startled.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Everyone yelled, &#8216;Run to second, run to second!&#8217; Catching his breath, Shay<br />awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the<br />base. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had<br />the ball &#8230; the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to<br />be the hero for his team. He could have thrown the ball to the<br />second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher&#8217;s intentions so<br />he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman&#8217; s<br />head. Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him<br />circled the bases toward home.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          All were screaming, &#8216;Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay&#8217;
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by<br />turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, &#8216;Run to third!<br />Shay, run to third!&#8217;
        </p>
        
        <p>
          As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on<br />their feet screaming, &#8216;Shay, run home! Run home!&#8217; Shay ran to home, stepped<br />on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the<br />game for his team.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          &#8216;That day&#8217;, said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face,<br />&#8216;the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity<br />into this world&#8217;.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Shay didn&#8217;t make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never<br />forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy, and coming home and<br />seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!</font>
