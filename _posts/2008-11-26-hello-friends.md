    It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything on my blog.  I have been very busy (Aren&#8217;t we all are?).  Busy with what you might ask ?   I have been busy with  studies.  I just completed my first term of my MBA program on August 3rd.  Only 5 more terms to go.  Well, I am sure that you are looking forward to me telling you all about consumer surplus, price discrimination or how to do depreciation expense  <img src="http://i0.wp.com/arulweb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=696" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" data-recalc-dims="1" />

      Ok, Ok, I will spare you from the details of my course.  Here are some things that I enjoyed during the first term

        <u>Alaska Airlines</u> is the airline of choice for most of us flying Seattle.  Our friend Rajnish was able to get us all MVP status with the amount of frequent flying we do.  One benefit of MVP status that we all love is their free upgrade program to business class.  Since becoming MVP, I have been upgraded to business class in all my trips.  That is 100% success rate.  Little perks like this makes commuting to bay area every other week easier.  Not to mention the hot roasted nuts that comes in business class. It is out of world.

          <u>Le Meridien </u>is downtown San Francisco is an awesome hotel.  This is where all Wharton students stay when the class is in session.  Wharton has special contract with the hotel so they take very good care of us.  Often , we get the best rooms with view of the San Francisco bay. Their staff is friendly and nice.  Most front desk people know us by our name and are very aware of our exam schedule.

            <u>San Francisco downtown</u> is very cool place to hang out.   Every Friday that I am in town, it is totally fun to hang out with my classmates.   We have a bar old ship room down the road from the hotel.  This is the favorite hangout spot for most of the Wharton West MBA students.  Friday night you can most of us at this bar.  San Francisco pier is only a block away from the hotel.   As many of you are aware, I absolutely love water.  One of my favorite activity is to take a walk to pier and hang out close to the water. </div>
