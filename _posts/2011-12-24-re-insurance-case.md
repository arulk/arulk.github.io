        Your client is the CEO of an insurance company who has been contacted by shareholders about a particular item in the financial statements that they are concerned about. The item concerned is ‘cost of reinsurance’ and had a value of (100) against it in 1999, which given the conventions of financial statements represents a cost of $100m.

        The insurance company has 9-10 lines of business, including but not limited to fire, property, and auto. Health and life insurance are not part of their portfolio.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The item ‘cost of reinsurance‘ represents the balance of reinsurance premium (paid by the insurer to the reinsurer) and reinsurance payout (paid by the reinsurer to the insurer as a result of claims).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        McKinsey looked at the trend over 10 years. In some years the ‘cost of reinsurance’ balance was positive, in others it was negative. Cumulatively over that time period the figure came to a negative balance of $300m which is significant when compared to the size of the insurers business.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Each insurance activity (fire, property, auto insurance) is organized as an independent business unit and each has its own separate reinsurance contract with a reinsurer. These contracts are similar to those we know as individuals. If the insurer agrees to a deductible, payout will only occur if damages exceed the amount agreed upon as the deductible. For a higher premium, payouts will be directly proportional to the damages incurred. For some types of risk the reinsurer offers a choice between proportional coverage and coverage with deductible, in other cases, only one type of contract may be available.
      </p>

        There are some risks that involve large samples and that are thus relatively predictable using statistical methods. Others are more discrete (e.g. reinsuring the launch of a new Ariane space rocket – it’s not part of this client’s business, but it gives you an idea of what I mean) for which payouts are subject to greater variability and for which reinsurance will continue to be desirable.

        The negative cumulative 10-year reinsurance cost is your cue. This tells you that the company may be paying more for reinsurance than it needs to. McKinsey decided to investigate whether the insurer could take on some of the risk itself instead of using the reinsurer. Note that the areas of business which rely on large samples are prime candidates while reinsuring the launch of a space rocket will most likely always require a reinsurer.

        As a consultant on this project you will also need to ascertain whether the client has enough reserves in order to survive ‘a bad year’ after it discontinues some reinsurance contracts.

        When pressed to identify the next steps, it’s tempting to ask whether competitor’s balance sheets feature a ‘cost of reinsurance’ item of the same magnitude. Don’t be lulled into a false sense of security of the answer is ‘yes’. You’re looking to give your client a competitive edge, and so settling for whatever mediocre practices your competitors keep, may be held against you.

        I don’t see how applying a framework would be beneficial here. In fact never even came close to using one, and got through to the next round.

        Before you do anything else, make sure you understand the insurers/reinsurers business model. No interviewer will hold it against you if you clarify this upfront, on the contrary. Based on my experience there’s always some money to be made in collecting money early and delaying payment whether you’re looking at credit card, insurance, or other financial services companies. It’s beyond the immediate scope of this case, but why not pick up some bonus points if you can.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There’s a certain element of trial and error. E.g. think aloud: ‘I know from reading the newspaper that only a small number of reinsurers exist (e.g. Munich Re, Swiss Re), and so shopping around for better premiums won’t reduce the client’s cost structure.’ A great way to engage your interviewer while at the same time giving them an insight into your thought pattern.
      </p>

        This may be an unusual case in that there was no numerical analysis or math required. Make sure you’re comfortable calculating in your head.
