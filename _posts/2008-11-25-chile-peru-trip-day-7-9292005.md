        <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Today is travel day. Flight from Pt Arenas to Santiago was good. We got last but one row.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>The last row seats were also empty so each of us took a row of seats each and slept, wrote journal, and listened to music. I lounged in Santiago airport. Flight to Arica was uneventful. The whole day was spent in travel. <span> </span>We got Arica airport on time.<span>  </span>Arica is in the middle of a desert. The airport is a very small airport. Arica is the northern most part of Chile. From here Peru border is only 20 minutes drive. We took a taxi from Arica to a place called Tacna in Peru. Taxi driver was very familiar with border crossing process. He helped us with everything from filling forms to clearing immigration.<span>  </span>When I entered Chile, air hostess gave me two immigration forms to fill.<span>  </span>I didn’t fill both (thinking that she must have given it to me by mistake). The immigration had asked me about second form, but she let me go with just one form.<span>  </span>It looks like you need to fill two forms. Immigration officer will keep one form and you are supposed to keep the other form and return it when you exit the country. <span> </span><span>  </span>Immigration office asked me for my form, and Of course, I didn’t have it.<span>  </span>Immigration officer was nice. He asked me to fill another one and let me go.<span>  </span>We walked from Chile to Peru boundary.<span>  </span>This is the first time I crossed from one country to another by foot. Peru immigration was also easy. </font></span></font>

            <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">Drive from border was in the middle of desert. Driver dropped us at the bus (it’s called buss ) station and asked a porter to help us.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>This porter helped us a lot with changing money, getting tickets etc. I remembered how things would be in Chennai. If you are new, you would be taken for ride.<span>   </span>Buses in Peru are three layered with two floors for passenger and storage in the bottom. <span> </span>The bus ride to Puna was 11 hours. Tacna is at sea level and Puno is at 3200M.<span>  </span>The 11 hour ride was to go up the mountain.<span>  </span>The ride was mostly good. However, it started to get very cold around 3AM in the morning.<span>  </span>Everyone else in bus had wool blanket.<span>  </span>Suguna and I didn’t have anything to cover us and the bus wasn’t heated (we should have known about this when people pulled out their blankets while boarding the bus). I started to shiver badly. Not a very good sign. <span> </span>The lady next to me saw our suffering and gave me a small blanket which Suguna and I used to cover ourselves.<span>  </span><span> </span><span> </span>Around 6, the chillness was gone and we felt much better. <span> </span>My body was feeling feverish.</font></span></font>

                <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">As we got close to Puno, there were many check posts. The reason for check post is that people smuggle electronics from Chile to Peru without paying customs duty. The check post is basically to check for this.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>Every time the bus stopped at the check post, some people in the bus were getting uneasy.<span>  </span>They will feel better after we clear check post.<span>  </span>Suguna and I were amused by this whole drama every time we crossed the check post. As we reached Puno, the cop in the check post asked the driver to pull the bus into a compound and asked every passenger to get down.<span>  </span>There were many cops in the compound.<span>  </span>They unloaded all packages and whenever they found electronics. They confiscated it.<span>  </span>We went and picked up our bags.<span>  </span>One cop asked and who we were and what we were doing. Once we showed our passport and visa, he let us go.<span>  </span>He even helped us by asking one of the cops to get us a taxi.</font></span></font>
