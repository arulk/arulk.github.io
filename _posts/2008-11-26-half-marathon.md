    I am always amazed at the stamina and determination people have to run Marathon.  I have always thought of figuring out what it takes to run a Marathon but never had the time or energy to do it.  Recently, one of my close friend <a href="http://http://okmadhavi.spaces.live.com/">Madhavi </a>ran half marathon for the first time. It was an inspiration and motivation for me. She did it as part of Asha fund raiser. When i came to know about Seattle Marathon, I decided that I should give it a try.  you have to learn to walk before you can run so I decided that I will run half marathon first.

    I have created this category to capture the trial and tribulations of my first attempt at running half marathon.
