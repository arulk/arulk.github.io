        Live in day tight compartments &#8211; Put a iron curtain on the past as it is gone.  Forget about tomorrow as it is not your hands. Live for today as that is the only thing you can control.

            Three step to avoiding worry 
            
            <p>
                 1. Find out what is the worst that could happen in given situation 
              
              <p>
                   2. Accept the worst situation. Once you accept the worst situation then fear and worry will abate. 
                
                <p>
                     3.  Figure out what best you could do to be in position other than worst case situation. You will be able to do this because you are not consumed by fear and worry which helps you think rationally.
