    Last blog was on heavy and serious subject so let&#8217;s make this blog on the lighter side. Two of the courses that I am  doing at Wharton this term are Marketing Management and  Marketing Strategy. Marketing is both art and science. Science part is explained by various terms and frameworks.  Applying science to real world marketing situation is the art part and we are learning that through case studies.  My class mate send the following as a way to teach Marketing terms.   Trust me, this not how our professor teach us the marketing concepts. If they did, we all would be excelling in our studies.

You&#8217;re at a party with a bunch of friends and see a gorgeous girl. One of your friends goes up to her and pointing at you says: "He&#8217;s very rich. "Marry him." -That&#8217;s Advertising<br />3. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and get her telephone number. The next day, you call and say: "Hi, I&#8217;m very rich. "Marry me &#8211; That&#8217;s Telemarketing<br />4. You&#8217;re at a party and see gorgeous girl. You get up and straighten your tie, you walk up to her and pour her a drink, you open the door (of the car) for her, pick up her bag after she drops it, offer her ride and then say: "By the way, I&#8217;m rich. Will you "Marry Me?" &#8211; That&#8217;s Public Relations<br />5. You&#8217;re at a party and see gorgeous girl. She walks up to you and says: "You are very rich! "Can you marry ! me?" &#8211; That&#8217;s Brand Recognition<br />6. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say: "I am very rich. Marry me!" She gives you a nice hard slap on your face. &#8211; That&#8217;s Customer Feedback<br />7. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say: "I am very rich. Marry me!" And she introduces you to her husband. &#8211; That&#8217;s demand and supply gap<br />8. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and before you say anything, another person come and tell her: "I&#8217;m rich. Will you marry me?" and she<br />goes with him &#8211; That&#8217;s competition eating into your market share<br />9. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and before you say: "I&#8217;m rich, Marry me!" your wife arrives. &#8211; That&#8217;s restriction for entering new markets
