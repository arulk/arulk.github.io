      <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">When you see one of your photos, you immediately recognize when and where it was taken.<span>   </span>Seeing a friend on the street, you will immediately remember all the times you shared together.<span>  </span>Our brain is capable of retaining mind-boggling amount of information, more than even the largest computer in the world.<span>  </span>As human beings, we are fortunate to have such a capability.</font>

          <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Having such memory power is a blessing at most times, however, it can be a curse too. In particular, people who have gone through trauma, losing a loved one, breakup in relationship, or betrayal by someone who you trusted most can have huge impact on the emotional well being of the individual.<span>  </span>In all these cases, people have to let go of their feelings, pick themselves up and move on with their life &#8211; easier said than done.<span>  </span>With our memory power, we are constantly reminded of what happened and it keeps haunting us for the rest of our lives.</font>

              <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was once told a story of how some hunters catch Monkeys.<span>  </span>They put wireframe cages with a banana inside all over the place. <span> </span>The monkeys seeing the banana inside the cage are allured to get them.<span>  </span>They will try to put their hands inside the cage and get the banana. However, since the space between wires would be small, they would not be able to pull the banana out of the cage.<span>   </span>When the hunters approach the cage, Monkeys could let go of the banana and save them, but they would be adamant about not leaving the banana and get caught by hunters. </font>

                  <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">Just like in the story, we hold on to things in life at the cost of our lives.<span>  </span>We are prisoners of our memory. </font>
