          <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:blue;font-size:10pt;"><font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>    </span>Have you ever been in a situation where you were in the middle of dinner and interrupted by a phone call?<span>  </span><span> </span>Most of us have been and we have often tried to answer these phone calls only to hear the marketing person on the other hand trying to sell you things that either you already have or you will probably never use.<span>  </span>I have been Verizon DSL customer for very long time and in spite of that, I get called by marketing people trying to sell me Verizon DSL service.<span>  </span>This happened to me several times.<span>  </span>Another irritating thing that I have experienced is that you get a call but when you answer the call, the call gets disconnected only for you to receive another call within few minutes.<span>  </span>Most telemarketer use computers to do the dialing of numbers and when they find a number which is answered then the computer hangs up on you and notifies the telemarketer who then calls you in few minutes. <span>  </span>When the number of solicitation calls that you receive on your home number is more than the personal calls then there is something definitely wrong. <span> </span>Either I don’t have too many friends calling me or marketing people have gone crazy.</font></span>

              <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:blue;font-size:10pt;">I circumvented this problem for many years by not answering any phone calls from numbers that I don’t recognize.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>I have also made my friends call me on my cell phone and never on my home phone number.<span>  </span>My home number exists solely for the purpose of filling up a number in various applications. <span> </span>That’s why it was such a great relief for me when I first heard about the National do not call registry. If you are not aware of this then please visit the website </font><a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx"><u><font color="#800080">https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx</font></u></a>. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>Using this service, you can register your phone number in the national registry and all telemarketers are not supposed to call the number in the do not call list.<span>  </span>There are few caveats though. If you have had any transaction with a merchant and have given your telephone number then they can call you for period of 3 months. Similarly, if you have called any business entity then they can call you anytime.<span>  </span>Next time if you get a message that says “Urgent message for you.<span>  </span>Please call 1-800-1234-5678.” <span> </span>Or something like that then be very cautious. Don’t return any calls if you don’t recognize the company that is calling you and leaving this sort of message.<span>  </span>If you are naïve and call back the number then you have basically given yourself to be called by the telemarketer who owns the 1-800 number.</font></span>

                    <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Today, someone at work forwarded me this link.<span><font face="Trebuchet MS">   </font></span></span><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:blue;font-size:10pt;"><a href="http://www.kiro710.com/Article.asp?id=218630&spid=7912"><u><font color="#0000ff">http://www.kiro710.com/Article.asp?id=218630&spid=7912</font></u></a>.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  Please listen to radio show, in particular the recorded telephone conversations. </span>This is what I call Telemarketing gone crazy.<span>   </span>Fake names and sense of anonymity that telephone provides has created monsters among some of the telemarketers.<span>   </span>The first telemarketer in this radio show should be fired from his job.<span>  </span>I am Dish Network customer and I totally like this company.<span>  </span>I am very disappointed that Dish Network is using people like the ones in recorded conversation for selling their products.<span>  </span>They need to make sure that they are not associated with people like this. If they continue, customers like me will stop associating with them.</font></span>
