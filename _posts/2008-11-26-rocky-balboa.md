          <font size="3"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Sans-serif"><font color="#3366ff">Rocky Balboa story is inspiring because life like boxing is a fight and you are in the ring with an opponent who has stellar <span> </span>track of knocking out people.<span>  </span><span> </span>Life throws punch after punch at you. You dodge most of them and get going.<span>  </span>However, Life often throws a knockout punch <span> </span>that <span> </span>puts you <span> </span>down.<span>  </span>It is often easy to give up and let yourself down.<span>  </span>We all need to have the fighting spirit of Rocky Balboa to get up from life’s knock down punch.</font></font></font>
