I haven&#8217;t written blog in ages and I am not sure if that is going to change but I am going to try.  Instead of trying to write long blog which I start writing but never end up finishing.  I have decided that I will start to write about what I am reading/learning/coding or general stuff happening in my day to day.  

With that, here&#8217;s my first update.

I have been interested in Machine Learning.  I find the field is very fascinating.  Although I have doing statistics and linear regression , which is a form of machine learning, there is more to this field that I don&#8217;t know.

In order to learn this more,  I have signed up for  [Machine Learning  course][1]  taught by Professor Andrew Ng at Coursera.  It starts on March 3rd.  I  have heard great things about this course.

Do you have other recommendations for  Machine Learning ?
