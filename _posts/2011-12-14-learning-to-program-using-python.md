Someone recently asked me how to learn to programming.&nbsp; My initial reaction was to&nbsp; tell them to pick up a book on C# or Java and start working through the introductory book on programming using&nbsp; one of these languages.&nbsp; This is a fairly reasonable suggestion coming from someone who has learnt programming using languages like Pascal, C and Fortran.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This person wanted me to help with initial hello world type program and so I fired up my&nbsp; Visual Studio&nbsp; and started writing “Hello World”

&nbsp;

I started to explain what this simple hello world program does.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where the trouble started.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this program does is&nbsp; prints&nbsp; “Hello World” to the console.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order for a new person to understand this code, they need to know&nbsp; using statements,&nbsp; namespaces,&nbsp; main function , arguments , etc.

Not an easy task for someone starting fresh.

&nbsp;

I thought about Basic programming language.&nbsp; It is very good learning language and easy for people to understand.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp; it is not a powerful language&nbsp; and I don’t know if&nbsp; many of the modern day programming concepts like object oriented programming can be learning using Basic.&nbsp; Later, My friend suggested me to check out Python.&nbsp; I looked at Python and was impressed with it simplicity.&nbsp; The above program becomes

&nbsp;

print “Hello World”

&nbsp;

in Python.&nbsp; Much simpler and easier to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t be fooled by thinking that Python is a toy language. Python language and it supporting libraries are quite powerful.&nbsp; I will try to blog more about Python in future blog posts.

&nbsp;

If someone is looking to learn to program, I would recommend them to learn Python.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have recommendations other than Python?
