      <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I had a very good night sleep after hike. I got up around 5.30. At 6, we got cocoa tea. While I was tea, I came to know that suguna wasn’t feeling well last night. We had our breakfast at around 6.30. After breakfast, we started to hike. Because it was a tough hike, I decided to hire a porter to carry my bad today. First 30 minutes of walk was gentle. We reached a checkpoint for verification. After that the hike started to go steep. To give you some idea, we started at altitude 2800m, we hiked up to 3300m during lunch time and then we hiked up another 500m to 3800m before hiking down to 3600m. This was one of toughest hiking day of my life. Hiking such a steep hill was a combination of physical strength and mental stamina.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>I maintained a pace that allowed me to breathe normal and kept pushing myself. While Suguna was getting better, Sandy was getting sick.<span>  </span>We hiked up to 3400M and took break for lunch.<span>  </span>The place was very cold and windy but had a beautiful view of the valley below, which is the valley from where we started hiking. It started to rain in the middle and the porters quickly put together a tent for us</font></span></font>

        <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">They gave us hot soup, but it felt so good for such a cold weather. After lunch, the hike was even harder. Every step was like a workout around Woodbridge. Somehow, I managed to hike up to the top. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>This is the highest point of the trial. <span> </span>Remember the ritual we did at the beginning of the hike. We completed the ritual at the highest point. </font></span></font>

          <p>
            <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I took some photos of the valley. These photos will remind me of all the hard work I had to do to reach the top. After spending few minutes, we continued our hike. This time we had to reach next campsite which is at 3600m. These Incas, I am telling you, could have created a trail to go from 3600-3600 instead of going up to 4200 and coming down. We had to hike up another 400m. Anyways, the rest of hike was down. It was hard on knees but wasn’t hard. Our campsite was located amidst clods. It was beautiful. I tried to capture it in camera but didn’t come quite well. Sorry folks. At 6.30, we had dinner- fried rice, chicken and Peruvian dessert. I wrote this in my tent which I had started to like.<font face="Trebuchet MS"><span>  </span>I was missing my friends and family.<span>  </span>I can’t wait to see them.</font></span></font>
