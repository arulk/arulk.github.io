    There are few movies that strike cord with you because they relate to your own life’s experiences. Gautam Menon’s latest movie Vaaranam Aayiram is one such movie.  Gautam has done a fantastic job portraying the relationship between father and son in this movie.

    What I liked about the movie is how Gautam has taken seemingly real life incidents and blended them into a narrative story.  There are many incidents in the movie which you can relate to in your personal life.

    Personally, I was moved by how the hero, played by Surya, who loses the love of his life deals with it in a very realistic manner.  I am sure that everyone has downs in their life. We find different ways to cope up with failure in love, job, studies etc.  In this movie, hero goes through his emotions to deal with the loss. He even goes to extreme of becoming a drug addict.  His father, also played by Surya, narrates him an example of how as kid he channeled his anger into a positive energy.  He asks him to channel his anger/helplessness at the loss into something positive.  Hero goes on a soul searching trip and rediscovers himself again.  He finally ends up being a Major in Indian Army.

    Often times, we get stuck because of some failure and it is hard for us to get past it. How cool it would be for us to be able to deal with it and move on with our failure.  I know it is easier said than done.  However, watching  someone who has gone through severe setback in their life, deal with it, and come out of the situation as an improved person is definitely very inspiring.  Surya’s character in this movie provides such an inspiration.
