        The only information provided at the beginning of the case was that the hotel was considering introducing mini-bars. Upon questioning the style of response was : « What do you think » ? and the interviewer asked me to make assumptions. Some of the assumptions that I made include
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · 90% business customers, 10% vacationers
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · 500 rooms -à 500 refrigerators.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · On an average it takes about 5 minutes/trip to check and restock refrigerators.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · I was asked to ignore the capital expenditure required for installing the refrigerator and the operating and maintenance cost for the equipment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · I assumed that the average person consumed 1 drink + 2 bottles of water + 1 bag of nuts.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · I also assumed that the margin (over the cost of the item) for the drink to be $4, bottle of water to be $2 and the bag of nuts to be $2.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · The average occupancy rate is 80%.

        <b>Solution:</b>
      </p>
    </td>
    
    <td valign="top" width="508">
      <p>
        Margin/room/day: $4 (drink)+ 2 x $2 (water) + $2 = $10
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Total margin/day: 500*0.8(occupancy rate)*$10 = $4000/day
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Total cost/day: 500 (refrigerators)*5 min/check = 2500 minutes ~ 40 hours* $10 (fully loaded cost) = $400/day.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Total profits/day = $3,600 /day. Seems like a profitable thing to do?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        However, there are lost revenues due to the fact that this cannibalizes sales at hotel bar and room service. The discussion became subjective at this point and it became apparent that if the lost revenue is greater than the revenue that is gained, this would not be a good thing to do. Then the interviewer asked me why do some of the hotels have a plastic tab over the handle and the answer is that – if the tab is not broken, then the refrigerator need not be checked.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Finally, the interviewer also asked me how I would collect the information and how I would launch this service. I suggested checking with suppliers to figure out how many of the small alcohol bottles that competitors are ordering. In addition, simply checking in to one of the competitor’s hotels for a night would provide a lot of intelligence. For launching the service, I suggested that I would introduce this on just one floor and see if this was a success before expanding it throughout the hotel.

        Structuring the valuation properly so that revenues and costs can be identified is critical. Also, acknowledging and identifying “cannibalization” was key to nailing the case.
