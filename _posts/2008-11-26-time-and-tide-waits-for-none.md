    I am amazed at how fast time flies.  It just felt like 2007 started just now and it is already 2008.   It is not that 2007 was a bad year or anything.  There were many significant events for me like getting into business school, finish writing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Windows-PowerShell-Programming-Providers/dp/0470173939/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199914554&sr=8-1">book</a> etc.  However, there are some goals that  I wanted to achieve but didn&#8217;t get around it.

      Sometimes, my life feels like the movie GroundHog day.   It is a movie about a guy who repeats his day over and over again until he has a perfect day.  The only difference for me is that  my day is same over and over again and it just doesn&#8217;t get any  better.

        I didn&#8217;t make any new year resolution because I don&#8217;t believe in them.   if you have made new year resolution, I hope that you achieve your new resolution.   Let 2008  bring you more of peace, happiness and well being.
