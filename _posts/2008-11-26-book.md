              I wrote this book along with my colleagues on Windows PowerShell, product that we are working on.  Project which started out as a simple blog project turned into a full blown book project.  I was originally planning to write this book alone, however after my MBA started, I realized that it is not possible for me to complete this book given my tight schedule.  My colleagues jumped in on the opportunity and this turned out to be a great experience for all us.

                  Writing a book is no easy task and requires tremendous amount of time on your part.  However, it is kind of cool to have a book published in your name.
