        This case is set in 1997. A consumer product company that manufactures a line of diet-food (think Slimfast) is looking at the Internet as an emerging opportunity to grow the top-line revenues. The case is broad strategy question of what should they do?

        <b>Solution:</b>

    <td valign="top" width="508">
      <p>
        Start by laying out the value chain of
      </p>
      
      <p>
        R&D à Mfg. à Mktg. à Distribution
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I was asked to focus on Marketing and Distribution. So, ignore R&D and manufacturing Internet Strategy.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Estimate the approximate market size:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        250MM * .25 (For the 35 – 55 age group) * .5 (above average population) = about 30MM as the target market.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Of this group, I was told that only 50% were interested in diet products and our client has a 30% share. This leads to 30*50%*33% = 5MM customers for the client. Therefore a total of 4MM women and 1MM men buy products worth $100/year to provide revenues of $500 Million.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Now to grow the top-line, you have to either increase the primary market and your share of the primary market or increase the revenue/customer. So my target marketing strategy was to accomplish both using the Internet.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I recommended age based segmentation so that the below 35 as well as the 55+ crowd could be attracted (a la, the Centrum Silver type of strategy). Also suggested that perhaps a premium brand could be launched which could get the GNC type of “hi-performance” product. However, this may entail increased costs on R&D.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Also, it is realistic to increase consumption by inventing ways to include the product as part of daily diet. To that end, I suggested a content based strategy which would involve creating a community online with perhaps helpful emails to monitor diet (inspired by ediet.com!). Provide nutrition guidance online. I felt that the regularity would drive primary usage of the product.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I also recommended that the firm not pursue a distribution strategy with the Internet for the following reasons:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · It would create channel conflict, thus angering retailers.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · Setting up distribution in the Internet invites price competition and is also more complicated.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        · The company is a relatively small company with about $500 MM in sales. It may not be able to accommodate both projects at the same time without disruption.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The BCG consultant concurred with my strategy and actually mentioned that this was in line with their recommendation to the client J.

        A broad mix of demonstrating quantitative ability and “big picture thinking” is critical to hit a home run with BCG cases. All in all, I found BCG cases to be the most fun during the case interview process.
