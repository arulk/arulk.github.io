      <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I got up and got ready to checkout Lima. I took a taxi to downtown and walked around plaza de aramas, checked out president’s plaza, and visited the cathedral</span></font>

        <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I went to the old railway station, where a Chinese cultural exhibition going on. I went to San Francisco church. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>The tour in the church was amazing. This church houses a library with books from 200 AD. The best part of the tour was the visit to catacombs. Catacombs are cemetery built under the church where they bury the bodies of people. <span> </span>Catacombs are like a maze with very small pathways. I saw bones of people buried some 400 years ago. It was an interesting experience because it made me think that we all end up as bones one day. It’s only one life we get so let’s live it up to the fullest. Enough digression.</font></span></font>

          <p>
            <font color="navy" size="2"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">I saw other churches in the downtown area. I took a walk along Jirion de la union which is a pedestrian mall. This walkway connects plaza de armas to plaza san martin. I totally enjoyed the walk seeing various people, street performers, various stores etc. I decided to walk towards my hotel and spend an hour walking on the street of Lima. Walking is the best way to explore city. Then, I hopped onto a local bus to get to hotel. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><span> </span>In evening, Marcela and Monica came and picked us up around 7.30. <span> </span>They drove us to an area called baranco which still houses 30’s building. It’s the home to many of the artists and writers it seems</font></span></font>

              <font color="navy" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS';color:navy;font-size:10pt;">After that, we went to dinner to a Peruvian food place. </span></font>
