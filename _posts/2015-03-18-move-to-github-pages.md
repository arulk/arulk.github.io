# Move to Github pages

I used to host my blog at [wordpres](http://www.wordpress.org).  Wordpress is a great blogging platform  but is requires you a hosting provider to host you blog.This is not big deal by itself as there are many hosting providers who provide service for very monthly fee. I use [Fastdomain](http://www.fastdomain.com) as my hosting provider who charges me approximately $6/month for my service. For low traffic site like my blog this shared hosting model is good enough.

There are other optiosn as well to use wordpress. [Windows Azure Websites](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/websites/) or  [AWS Websites](http://aws.amazon.com/websites/) can be used if you are looking for scalable solution for high traffic website.

##Why move to Github pages?
You might be wondering then why did I move to Githug pages.  First of all, it is absolutely free.  Second, Github pages use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which allows me to write my blog post like this using Markdown syntax and it will automatically convert to html syntax.

Most important of all, I can create my blog posts like the way I create code.  The whole github pages that is hosting my blog is nothing but a git hub repository.  What this means is that I can create / update my blog just like I work on any other project source code.

I will write my experience migrating from wordpress to githug pages in a seperate blog post.
